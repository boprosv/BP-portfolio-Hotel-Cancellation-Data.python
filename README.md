# BP-portfolio-Hotel-Cancellation-Data.python

In this project I used a Hotel Cancellation Data CSV format file with 36K bookings from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/youssefaboelwafa/hotel-booking-cancellation-prediction/data)
I have attuched a RAW copy in .ipynb format if you would like to run the code.

The project:

To start, I downloaded all the needed libraries for what I wanted to do, the dataset was clean and not much needed to be done to prepare the data, just some checkups.
